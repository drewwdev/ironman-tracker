## Description

The Old School RuneScape Ironman Tracker is a web application built to track the progress of Ironman accounts in Old School RuneScape. It allows Ironman players to monitor their skill levels, achievements, and other statistics in their journey towards becoming self-sufficient adventurers.

The web app is developed using TypeScript and utilizes Tailwind CSS for the frontend UI. Data is retrieved from the Wise Old Man API, which provides comprehensive data on Old School RuneScape player stats and achievements.

This project was inspired by a Reddit thread in the Ironscape community, which you can find here: [Ironscape Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ironscape/comments/12zrf12/i_have_been_working_on_a_huge_goals_and/).
